This script connects to the Polkadot network and retrieves the balance of a specified account. It uses the @polkadot/api and @polkadot/keyring packages to establish a connection, retrieve the account balance, and log it to the console.

To use the script, replace the address variable with the actual Polkadot account address for which you want to check the balance.

Please ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including the @polkadot/api and @polkadot/keyring packages, before running the script.

Feel free to modify and customize the script to suit your specific needs, such as fetching additional account details or performing other operations on the Polkadot network.
